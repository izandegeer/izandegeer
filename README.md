  ## About me

  Hey! I'm Izan, a Web Application Development student based in Alicante, Spain.
  I got here after a brief —but valuable— detour through Telecommunications
  Engineering, where I realized what truly drives me is building things for the
  web.

  My main focus is web development, both frontend and backend, aiming to write
  clean, functional and meaningful code. I also have a background in graphic
  design, which helps me pay attention to visual detail when needed.

  explanations. 🕹️
